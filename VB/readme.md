# Dashboard Client-Side Application (Angular)

This example is a ready-to-use client Angular application with the DevExpress Dashboard component.

> **Documentation**: [Client-Side Configuration (Angular)](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/400409)

The example uses a modular approach that based on the client-server model. You need a server (backend) project and a client (frontend) application that includes all the necessary styles, scripts and HTML-templates. Note that the script version on the client should match with libraries version on the server up to a minor version.

The server project hosts on ```https://demos.devexpress.com/services/dashboard/api```.

The [JS](JS) folder contains a client application.

## Quick Start

1. Open the **JS** folder. In the command prompt, download and install npm packages used in the application:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

2. In the same folder, run the following command to compile and run the application:

    ```bash
    ng serve --open
    ```

3. Open ```http://localhost:4200/``` in your browser to see the result. The HTML JavaScript Dashboard displays the dashboard stored on the preconfigured server (```https://demos.devexpress.com/services/dashboard/api```).
